**SMART-HELMET-IOT** is an IOT based smart helmet which was developed by team CODE SPEAR for an all INDIA level competition
and ended up scoring 10th rank.

SMART-HELMET-IOT ensures that the rider wears the helmet properly and makes sure that motor vehicle won't function
until rider wears the helmet. It uses capactive touch sensors to detect human presence which aslo ensures that the rider won't be able to use cell phone while driving making the ride more safer and integrating the system with the motor vehicle engine which ensures that no one can mishandle it.

SMART-HELMET-IOT is developed in such a way that it can be easily integrated with all the current operating vehicles and helmet,
so there is no need to buy a new helmet or a new vehicle.

SMART-HELMET-IOT is also feasible and will cost less than 300 rupees for the whole system.
